# Custom-Neural-Network-Model-in-PyTorch-Breast-Cancer
This repository contains a simple implementation of a custom neural network in PyTorch designed for basic regression tasks. The network uses a single-layer perceptron (SLP) with a custom-defined forward pass and manual backpropagation.

Custom Neural Network: Implemented a custom MyNeuralNN class with basic initialization of weights and biases.

Manual Backpropagation: Instead of using PyTorch's built-in optimizers, backpropagation and parameter updates are handled manually using gradient calculations.

Optimization via Gradient Descent: The model's parameters are updated through gradient descent, with the gradients calculated and applied after each forward pass.

Tensor Operations with PyTorch: Utilizes PyTorch tensors for all matrix operations and calculations, leveraging its automatic differentiation engine.
